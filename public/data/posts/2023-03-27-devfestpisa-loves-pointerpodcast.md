Organizing a large-scale event like the **DevFest Pisa 2023** requires a lot of commitment and a lot of time that is often invisible to the participant on the day of the event. For this reason, the [PointerPodcast](https://pointerpodcast.it/p/pointer145-organizzare-una-devfest-con-il-gdg-pisa/) team was curious to discover more what's going on behind the scene of DevFest Pisa and interviewed some of the organizers behind the DevFest Pisa 2023.

During the interview, Alessandro and Luca from PointerPodcast got the opportunity to ask [some members of our team](/team), namely Nicola, Mary, Giovanni, Leonardo, and Alex several questions about:

* The **origins** of GDG Pisa
* The **history** behind the first DevFest Pisa in 2018, the DevFest Pisa **0.1**;
* The reasons behind the delay of the DevFest Pisa 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
* The organization, the tools used, and the **goals** of DevFest Pisa 2023;
* Why public speaking is important;

and much more!
