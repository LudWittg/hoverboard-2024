Hi everyone,

Let's kickoff this week with new additions to the DevFest Pisa agenda: 🛠️ **workshops**!

Workshops are a great way to learn new skills and to get hands-on experience with new technologies. There is not better way to learn than, **learn by doing**!

That's why this year you'll have the opportunity to experience **3 workshops**.
Those workshops will allow you to dabble in new technologies such as Security, Quantum Computing, Firebase!

Please note that those workshops requires you to do an **extra registration** (you need to get both the DevFest ticket AND the workshop ticket). This is to make sure the number of participants to each workshop is limited and we allow the speaker to have time to support everyone.

Let's check them out:
