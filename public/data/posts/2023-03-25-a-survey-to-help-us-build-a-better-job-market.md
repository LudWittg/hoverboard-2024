Hi all,
Today we'd like to share with you an initiative from on of our supportner and partner, [Tech Jobs Fair](https://techjobslist.com/):

Are you willing to learn new technologies? Would you like to work with systems at scale? Are you looking for a relaxed working environment?
But... How do you find a company that suits your expectations?

As the technology industry continues to grow and evolve, the need for professionals increases. Finding and attracting top talent is important for many companies in this field. On the other side, developers struggle to find the perfect project due to a lack of information and transparency. 
This year, DevFest Pisa 2023 is partnering with Tech Jobs Fair, a series of events where demand and offer meet. 

As part of the initiative, Tech Jobs Fair prepared a **survey** with the purpose of improving the current Job market and helping both developers and companies.

We at GDG Pisa strongly believe in the importance of building a more fair and transparent tech job market. We'll be specifically reserving a space for our [job board at DevFest Pisa 2023](/blog/introducing-the-job-board) for anyone to share their job offers.

We also believe this survey goes in this similar direction, and we would to support Tech Job Fair in promoting it:

Thank you in advance, and see you at DevFest Pisa 2023!
