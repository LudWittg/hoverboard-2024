Hi everyone,

We had a blast at DevFest Pisa 2023, and we hope you did too! It was amazing to see so many developers, enthusiasts, and learners come together in Pisa to network and share their passion for technology.

Again, we want to thank all the speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and attendees who made this event possible and memorable. We couldn't have done it without you!

First, make sure you check the official **video recap** of the event, a short video that summarizes the best moments of the conference:
