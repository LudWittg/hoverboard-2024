Hi everyone,

Today, the 8th of March, we're happy to celebrate the **International Women's Day** 👩‍💻.
At GDG Pisa, Diversity and Inclusion is a topic close to hour heart. 

Together with [WTM Pisa](https://gdgpisa.it/wtm), our local woman techmaker community, we decided to celebrate IWD at DevFest Pisa with a **fully dedicated track**, the IWD track!

You read it right, we're adding another track to the DevFest Pisa agenda, which will be all focused on **women in tech**, **diversity**, **inclusion** and **soft skills**. You can find those events marked in purple 💜 in the schedule.

Those talks will run in parallel with the other tracks with more tech-specific talks. We hope this will give you a wide diversity of topics at let you enjoy DevFest Pisa even more.

Talking about diversity, we're extremely proud of the amount of diversity in the IWD track, and we're happy to welcome on stage another round of amazing speakers:
