Oh no... you missed it!

We're happy to announce that **all tickets** for DevFest Pisa 2023 are **sold out**! ðŸŽ‰
That's so exciting to see that our event in such an high demand!

Sadly due to capacity, we're not able to accept any more registrations at this point.
However, we've decided to open a **waiting list** for those who missed the chance to get a ticket.

If you got a ticket and you **can't attend anymore**, please please please cancel it as soon as possible.
This will free up the spot to someone else who's on the waiting list and wants to join.

From our experience, some participants won't show up on the day of the event, so we'll be able to offer some tickets to the people on the waiting list. If you're interested in joining the waiting list, please do it by using the button below:
