Hi everyone,

Let us tell you... it has been a bumpy ride to get to this point. 

Sadly, due to some flights cancellations, we had to make some last minute changes to our schedule. 

Specifically the sessions **Bring machine learning to Android with ML Kit** and the session **Clean Architecture with Jetpack Compose** have been cancelled. They have been replaced by the following sessions:

- [cgo: avoid shooting yourself in the foot](/sessions/cgo_avoid_shooting_yourself_in_the_foot_cintura) by [**Antonio Pitasi**](/speakers/antonio_pitasi) (Qredo - Pisa ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹)
- [How to build a DevFest](/sessions/how_to_build_a_devfest) by [**Nicola Corti**](/speakers/nicola_corti) (Kotlin GDE - London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§)

Furthermore, we had to do a couple of **changes** to the schedule due to changes of travel arrangements of some speakers.

As a reminder, you can **login** on the website and start creating **your schedule** for DevFest Pisa.
If you turn on the **push notifications**, you will be notified when the session you liked are about to start.

DevFest Pisa is close, and we can't be more than excited to see you all tomorrow at 8:30 AM!
