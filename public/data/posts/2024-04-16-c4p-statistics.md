## Call for Papers is closed! ‚úñÔ∏è

We're excited to announce that the Call for Papers for DevFest Pisa 2024 is officially closed!

This year, we have **received more than 100 proposals**! üòç

As we conclude this year's call for speakers for the upcoming DevFest in Pisa, we want to thank all the speakers who submitted proposals to make an impact at this year's event.

We would love to feature all their amazing proposals at DevFest Pisa 2024, but unfortunately, this is not possible. Given the capacity of our event, we expect to have an acceptance ratio of only 25-30%.

But let's start with some statistics!

As in previous years, procrastination is part of our CFP üòÇ 
The last proposal was sent on Sunday, **April 14th at 11:40 PM**.

You can see the trend of the CFP submissions in this graph:

The highly diverse yet rich nature of the various topics and speaker backgrounds sets the tone for an unforgettable experience in Pisa on June 1st.

We will soon reveal the first speakers of DevFest Pisa 2024, but in the meantime, don't forget to grab your free ticket! üé´ 

Looking forward to seeing you in June! ‚òÄÔ∏è ‚õ±Ô∏è
