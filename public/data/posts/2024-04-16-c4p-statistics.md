## Call for Papers is closed! ‚úñÔ∏è

We're excited to announce that the Call for Papers for the DevFest Pisa 2024 is officially closed!

This year, we have received **100+ proposals**! üòç

As we round off this year's call for speakers for the forthcoming DevFest in Pisa, we want to thank all the speakers who have submitted proposals to make an impact at this year's edition. 

We would love to have all their amazing proposals at DevFest Pisa 2024 but unfortunately, this is not possible. Considering the capacity of our event, we expect to have an acceptance ratio of only 25/30%. 

But let's start with some statistics!

As in previous years, procrastination  is part of our CFP üòÇ 
The last proposal was sent on Sunday the **14 of April at 11.40 pm**.

You can see the trend of the CFP submissions in this graph:

The highly diverse yet rich nature of the various topics and speaker backgrounds sets the tone for an unforgettable experience in Pisa On the 1st of June.
